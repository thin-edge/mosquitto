/*
 * Function: mosquitto_subscribe
 *
 * Subscribe to a topic.
 *
 * It is valid to use this function for clients using all MQTT protocol versions.
 * If you need to set MQTT v5 SUBSCRIBE properties, use <mosquitto_subscribe_v5>
 * instead.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *	mosq - a valid mosquitto instance.
 *	mid -  a pointer to an int. If not NULL, the function will set this to
 *	       the message id of this particular message. This can be then used
 *	       with the subscribe callback to determine when the message has been
 *	       sent.
 *	sub -  the subscription pattern - must not be NULL or an empty string.
 *	qos -  the requested Quality of Service for this subscription.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS -        on success.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_INVAL -          if the input parameters were invalid.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_NOMEM -          if an out of memory condition occurred.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_NO_CONN -        if the client isn't connected to a broker.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_MALFORMED_UTF8 - if the topic is not valid UTF-8
 *	MOSQ_ERR_OVERSIZE_PACKET - if the resulting packet would be larger than
 *	                           supported by the broker.

/*
 * Function: mosquitto_subscribe_v5
 *
 * Subscribe to a topic, with attached MQTT properties.
 *
 * Use e.g. <mosquitto_property_add_string> and similar to create a list of
 * properties, then attach them to this publish. Properties need freeing with
 * <mosquitto_property_free_all>.
 *
 * If the mosquitto instance `mosq` is using MQTT v5, the `properties` argument
 * will be applied to the PUBLISH message. For MQTT v3.1.1 and below, the
 * `properties` argument will be ignored.
 *
 * Set your client to use MQTT v5 immediately after it is created:
 *
 * mosquitto_int_option(mosq, MOSQ_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, MQTT_PROTOCOL_V5);
 *
 * Parameters:
 *	mosq - a valid mosquitto instance.
 *	mid -  a pointer to an int. If not NULL, the function will set this to
 *	       the message id of this particular message. This can be then used
 *	       with the subscribe callback to determine when the message has been
 *	       sent.
 *	sub -  the subscription pattern - must not be NULL or an empty string.
 *	qos -  the requested Quality of Service for this subscription.
 *	options - options to apply to this subscription, OR'd together. Set to 0 to
 *	          use the default options, otherwise choose from list of <mqtt5_sub_options>
 * 	properties - a valid mosquitto_property list, or NULL.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS -        on success.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_INVAL -          if the input parameters were invalid.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_NOMEM -          if an out of memory condition occurred.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_NO_CONN -        if the client isn't connected to a broker.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_MALFORMED_UTF8 - if the topic is not valid UTF-8
 *	MOSQ_ERR_DUPLICATE_PROPERTY - if a property is duplicated where it is forbidden.
 *	MOSQ_ERR_PROTOCOL - if any property is invalid for use with SUBSCRIBE.
 *	MOSQ_ERR_OVERSIZE_PACKET - if the resulting packet would be larger than
 *	                           supported by the broker.

/*
 * Function: mosquitto_subscribe_multiple
 *
 * Subscribe to multiple topics.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *	mosq - a valid mosquitto instance.
 *	mid -  a pointer to an int. If not NULL, the function will set this to
 *	       the message id of this particular message. This can be then used
 *	       with the subscribe callback to determine when the message has been
 *	       sent.
 *  sub_count - the count of subscriptions to be made
 *	sub -  array of sub_count pointers, each pointing to a subscription string.
 *	       The "char *const *const" datatype ensures that neither the array of
 *	       pointers nor the strings that they point to are mutable. If you aren't
 *	       familiar with this, just think of it as a safer "char **",
 *	       equivalent to "const char *" for a simple string pointer.
 *	       Each string must not be NULL or an empty string.
 *	qos -  the requested Quality of Service for each subscription.
 *	options - options to apply to this subscription, OR'd together. This
 *	          argument is not used for MQTT v3 susbcriptions. Set to 0 to use
 *	          the default options, otherwise choose from list of <mqtt5_sub_options>
 * 	properties - a valid mosquitto_property list, or NULL. Only used with MQTT
 * 	             v5 clients.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS -        on success.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_INVAL -          if the input parameters were invalid.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_NOMEM -          if an out of memory condition occurred.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_NO_CONN -        if the client isn't connected to a broker.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_MALFORMED_UTF8 - if a topic is not valid UTF-8
 *	MOSQ_ERR_OVERSIZE_PACKET - if the resulting packet would be larger than
 *	                           supported by the broker.
